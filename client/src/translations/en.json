        "description1": "Subatomic particles exhibit dual nature - they can behave both as waves and particles, depending on how they are observed. It is observation that causes the \"wave function collapse\" - the transition from an undetermined state of possibilities to concrete reality.",

This is not a matter of technology - this is how the universe works at the quantum level."
